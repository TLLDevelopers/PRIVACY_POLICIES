TLL Corp. ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Tango (Sun & Moon Logic Puzzle) mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

1. Information Collection and Use
We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

A. Data Collected by Us (Locally on Your Device)
Our Service provides puzzle game functionality. To make this work, we store certain information locally on your device using your device's internal storage (such as SharedPreferences). This information is not transmitted to us or any third party by us. This includes:

Game Progress: Your current level, completed levels, and star ratings.

Game State: The current state of any puzzle you have in progress, including the board layout and your elapsed time.

Best Times: Your record times for completing puzzles.

Global Hint Balance: The number of hints you have available.

You can remove this data at any time by clearing the application's data or uninstalling the Service from your device.

B. Personal and Non-Personal Data Collected by Third-Party Services
We partner with third-party services to support our Service, primarily for displaying advertisements and for understanding how our Service is used. These partners may collect information from you.

i. Google AdMob (Advertising)

Our Service uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google Inc.

What it collects: Google AdMob may collect and use data such as your device's unique Advertising Identifier (IDFA or GAID), IP address, device information (e.g., model, OS version), and information about your interactions with the ads shown in our Service.

Why it's collected: This data is used to provide personalized (and non-personalized) advertising to you and to help us monetize our free-to-play app.

Google's Policy: For more information on how Google uses data, please visit: Google's Privacy & Terms

ii. Firebase (Analytics)

We use Firebase, a service provided by Google, for application analytics and to ensure stability.

What it collects: Firebase Analytics may collect data such as your device's Advertising Identifier, app usage data (e.g., screens you visit, buttons you tap, session duration), and crash/performance data.

Why it's collected: This helps us understand how users interact with our Service, what features are popular, and to identify and fix bugs, allowing us to improve the app.

Firebase Policy: For more information on Firebase, please visit: Privacy and Security in Firebase

2. How We Use Your Information
We use the data we and our partners collect for the following purposes:

To provide and maintain the core functionality of the Service (e.g., saving your progress).

To serve advertisements, which support the free-to-play model (via AdMob). This includes showing rewarded video ads to earn in-game hints at your option.

To monitor the usage of our Service and gather analysis or valuable information so that we can improve our Service (via Firebase Analytics).

To detect, prevent, and address technical issues or crashes.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others.

We may share non-personal, aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information with our business partners (like Google) for the purposes outlined above (e.g., for analytics and advertising).

We may also disclose your data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

To comply with a legal obligation.

To protect and defend the rights or property of TLL Corp.

To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service.

To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.

4. Your Privacy Rights and Choices
A. Opting Out of Personalized Advertising
You can opt-out of personalized advertising by following the instructions for your mobile device.

On Android: Go to Settings > Google > Ads > Reset advertising ID (or "Opt out of Ads Personalization").

Please note that you will still see ads, but they may not be as relevant to your interests.

B. Data Deletion Request
Because we do not have user accounts, we do not store personal information that directly identifies you on our servers.

Local Data: As stated in section 1.A, all your game progress is stored locally. You can delete this at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing the app's cache and data through your device settings.

Third-Party Data: Data collected by our partners (Google AdMob, Firebase) is associated with your device's advertising identifier. Resetting your advertising identifier (see section 4.A) will disassociate future data from you and make past data anonymous.

If you have any concerns or wish to make a data-related request, please contact us at tll.developers.apps@gmail.com, and we will assist you with the process as it relates to our third-party partners.

5. Security of Data
The security of your data is important to us. We use commercially reasonable methods to protect the information on your device. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable.

6. Children's Privacy
Our Service is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
