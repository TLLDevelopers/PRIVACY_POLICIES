Privacy Policy for Math Flux
Effective Date: January 2, 2026

TLL Developers ("we", "our", or "us") built the Math Flux app as a Freemium or Ad-Supported app. This SERVICE is provided by us at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of information if anyone decides to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use
For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information.

We want to clarify that we, as developers, do not actively collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your real name, email address, physical address, or phone number directly.

However, the app uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify your device, analyze app usage, and detect errors in order to improve app stability and gameplay.

The information collected automatically through these outside services may include:

Your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address (often anonymized).

Device type, model, and manufacturer.

Operating system version.

App configuration, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other general usage statistics.

Service Providers (Third Parties)
We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

To facilitate our Service;

To provide the Service on our behalf;

To perform Service-related services (like data analytics and bug tracking); or

To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to certain Usage Data. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

Below is the link to the privacy policy of the third-party service providers used by the app:

Google Analytics for Firebase: https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics

(If you use another service like Unity Analytics, add their link here)

Log Data (Crash Reporting)
We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in the case of an error in the app, we collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data or "Crashlogs". This data helps us identify what caused the error so we can fix it in future updates.

Security
We value your trust in providing access to usage information, thus we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it through our third-party partners. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Children’s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13 explicitly, although the content is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do the necessary actions.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
